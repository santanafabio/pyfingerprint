# Python library for ZFM fingerprint sensors

The PyFingerprint library allows to use ZhianTec ZFM-20, ZFM-60, ZFM-70 and ZFM-100 fingerprint sensors on the Raspberry Pi or other Linux machines. Some other models like R302, R303, R305, R306, R307, R551 and FPM10A also work.

**Note:** The library is inspired by the C++ library from Adafruit Industries:

## How to use the library

### Enroll a new finger

    See examples/example_enroll.py

### Search an enrolled finger

   See examples/example_search.py

### Delete an enrolled finger

    See examples/example_delete.py

### Download image of a scanned finger

    See examples/example_downloadimage.py

### Generate a 32-bit random number on the ZFM hardware PRNG

    See examples/example_generaterandom.py
